# (useful) IAM polcies

These are mainly policies I've been using day in day out in all new AWS projects. The policies sit inside the folder of their respective main purpose service. There are currently two types of policies: _gui_ and _minimum_. GUI policies provide the necessary permissions for a normal user to interact with the service within the AWS management console, the minimal policies are tuned to provide least privilege policies for automated processes.

I am trying to make these policies quite verbose and split the permissions into different sections so they make more sense when looked at and are easy to take bits out of.

Hope this helps :)
